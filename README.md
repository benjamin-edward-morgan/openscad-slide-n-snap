# slide-n-snap
Use these openscad modules to attach two FDM printed parts rigidly together after printing with no additional hardware. Parts can be attached in such away that separating them is very difficult. Male and female parts should be printed in their given orientations to maximize the tensile strength of the connection. The two parts slide and snap together. A living spring and hook will snap and lock the pieces in place when they are assembled.
